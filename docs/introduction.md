## Spartan Protocol

![Spartan Protocol Bram Header](/_media/BramHeader.png)

With Binance Smart Chain on the brink of launching on mainnet and the ever-increasing gas costs on Ethereum, a group of motivated Binance community members saw the opportunity to develop a platform that takes advantage of the opportunities provided by the faster and cheaper EVM chain. An extensive DeFi platform for the community with equal access and participation by all.

**- Telegram:** https://t.me/SpartanProtocolOrg  
**- Website:** https://SpartanProtocol.org  
**- DApp:** https://DApp.SpartanProtocol.org  

Core points Spartan Protocol was built on:

- The project is built, maintained and governed by the community
- Fair launch - existing assets destroyed to acquire $SPARTA through a process referred to as _Proof-of-Burn_
- Binance Chain communities selected to participate - drive forward BSC adoption and education
- The Protocol starts as decentralised as possible, with further decentralisation as the project matures
- The Protocol strives towards full automation, with any ongoing maintenance enacted by the community DAO

Spartan Protocol combined some new and fresh ideas with many varied and popular aspects of the DeFi landscape to utilise the best parts of great protocols such as:

- Thorchain ($RUNE)
- Bancor ($BNT)
- UniSwap ($UNI)
- Vader Protocol ($VADER)

> Spartan Protocol is a custom-built AMM, **not** the usual UniSwap copy-paste clone. Our code has been built by the community from the ground up (not a fork) with inherently unique liquidity pool features such as:
>
> - Liquidity sensitive fees (No fixed fee, trends to zero with increased liquidity)
> - Common settlement asset ($SPARTA, acting as a global price anchor)

##### Liquidity Pools

Spartans can provide liquidity to the pools to earn the revenue generated by the pool along with any extra dividends and incentives. Assets provided as liquidity will fluctuate with the prices of the underlying assets in the pools and you may end up with less of one asset, but more of the other as your position is balanced resulting in something similar to an automated DCA-in, DCA-out trading strategy with revenue yield on top.

##### Swap / Trade

This unique liquidity model allows Spartan Protocol's pools to be very capital efficient, trending towards providing the cheapest routes for anyone swapping tokens on BSC. Being a protocol, the contracts are open to be plugged into aggregators and DApps all over the ecosystem, continuing to open up cheap and fast paths to swap between BSC assets.

##### Synthetic Assets

As the pools get deeper, they allow users to forge special synthetic versions of the underlying assets (Synths). Synths allow you to earn yield on an otherwise stagnant assets in varied market conditions.

##### Stake Tokens

Staking is when you send your assets to a special contract and put it to work earning you extra yield. Liquidity providers can stake their LP tokens in the DaoVault to earn extra SPARTA yield on top of the LP token revenue. Synth holders can stake their Synth tokens in the SynthVault to earn SPARTA or compounding Synth yield too.

##### DAO Governance

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governs many of the variables and aspects of the protocol on-chain and in an automated fashion. As a liquidity provider you have open freedom to propose a change and vote to have it enacted in a censorship-resistant manner.

## The SPARTA token

![Spartan Protocol Token Header](/_media/TokenHeader.png)

The SPARTA token is essential to the protocol. It acts as the settlement asset for **every pool** meaning that all pools are paired with SPARTA. This in turn has the token acting as the essential element in the protocol's decentralised oracle. The price of any listed token can be derived from it's pooled ratio with SPARTA **without the dependence on any external oracle.**

?> **V2 Token Contract:** [0x3910db0600eA925F63C36DdB1351aB6E2c6eb102](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3910db0600eA925F63C36DdB1351aB6E2c6eb102)

##### Token Distribution

One of the biggest statements of Spartan Protocol is its fair launch. The community who formed the idea of the protocol was sick of the scams, rug-pulls and general degen, scummy greedy behaviour going on in the DeFi world. So they created a plan to launch the token **without all the bizarre rent seeking aspects found all over the DeFi world.** Flip the whole thing on its head, making most of the common scam behaviour not even possible with:

- No Airdrops
- No token sale
- No private sale
- No team allocation
- No treasury allocation
- **Only: 100% community allocation**

> **With no 'team' allocation, there is no rug to pull!**

Every new SPARTA token can only be obtained through Proof-of-Burn, liquidity incentives or the Bond program.

> Planned Max Supply: 300,000,000  
> Burned Supply: 57,480,300  
> **New Max Supply: 242,519,700 (-19.16%)**  
> (Smaller max supply than set out in whitepaper 😍)
>

> Planned Initial Allocation: 100,000,000  
> Proof-of-Burn: 42,414,904  
> Bond Program: 23,500,000  
> **Finalised Initial Allocation: 65,914,904 (-34.08%)**  
> (Smaller allocation than set out in whitepaper 😍)

##### Proof-of-Burn

Proof-of-Burn (PoB) was a novel, unique initial token distribution phase designed by the community who built on some PoB concepts talked about or attempted by other projects in the past. As contrast to the standard in most projects, it attempted to ensure there was no-one profiting from each token being created. Instead, new Spartans would have to **permanently burn** their existing assets (like BNB for instance) to receive an equal value in SPARTA. Giving up assets of value (which are provably burned and not transferred to anyone else) helps build a base price for the SPARTA token and ensure there are no bad actors to dump the token or pull the rug. The PoB phase ended with over 130K units of BNB burned along with many other Binance Chain tokens.

##### Bond Program

The Bond program was the longer-term 2nd phase of the SPARTA token distribution involving bonding an asset with SPARTA and locking it in as liquidity for 6 - 12 months. This ensured Spartans had a long period to learn and align themselves with the protocol, whilst witnessing first-hand the revenue potential of providing liquidity to the pools. Many diamond-handed Spartans were forged by this program and continue to provide liquidity to this day, despite having part of their Bond position unlocked and free for removal.

##### Liquidity Incentives

A controlled and ever-decreasing amount of SPARTA is emitted daily to a reserve contract and allocated for liquidity incentives to reward liquidity providers in the most active pools. This SPARTA only enters circulation via incentives which benefit the good peers in the ecosystem. *Spartans providing liquidity are good Spartans!*

> **DailyEmissions = (MaxSupply - TotalSupply) / (EmissionCurve)**
>
> MaxSupply = 300,000,000 SPARTA  
> TotalSupply = 162,000,000 SPARTA (At time of writing)  
> EmissionCurve = 2048
>
> 300M - 162M = 138M  
> 196M / 2048 = 67,382 SPARTA and decreasing every day!
>
> *The TotalSupply used in the daily calculation is ALL minted SPARTA.*   
> *Yes, this includes all the SPARTA that was burned & SPARTA that is not yet circulating!*

## Liquidity Sensitive Fees

It is very important to devote a section here specifically to the liquidity sensitive fee model used in Spartan Protocol as this really sets it apart from other AMMs on BSC. Spartan Protocol utilises slip-based fees to reward its liquidity providers. Whilst this dynamic system is fairly unique on BSC, it has been utilised on other blockchains, proving itself to be advantageous over the standard fixed-fee model in many regards.

The size of a transaction, over the depth of the liquidity pool, is what defines the demand for liquidity, so having a fee that's proportional to the liquidity solves several key problems. One such advantage of slip-based fees is that when demand for liquidity is high, the value-capture is much better for the providers of the liquidity. On the flip side of this, in times of low demand, the fees are reduced, thus making the Spartan pools more attractive to traders and aggregators.

Slip-based fees also have the lovely side-effect of acting as a security layer to the pools. The more a user demands liquidity, the more they have to pay for it. This in turn makes sandwich attacks or manipulation of any kind increasingly more expensive with fees increasing on an exponential scale. If someone was to attempt a malicious act, the most likely outcome is that the liquidity providers will earn some outstanding fees from the pool.

The relatively tiny fees for small trades, of which are what the majority of users will trade, means that Spartan Pools become a leader on the various aggregators that have sprung up in DeFi. The huge benefit of this is that Spartan Protocol can be extremely competitive across BSC, and generate vast amounts of swap revenue without swappers ever having to visit any Spartan DApp directly.

100% of fees never leave the pool they are generated in and attributed directly to the existing liquidity providers, creating circular incentives to keep the pools trending deeper. No-one is a middle-man to this revenue, the project was always built for the community rather than an individual's personal profit, and that remains the #1 goal.
