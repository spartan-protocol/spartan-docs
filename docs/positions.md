## Positions

Assessing whether you are 'up' or 'down' since entering a DeFi position is very helpful, everyone wants to do it. Problem is, it's extremely difficult to do and there is *alot* of subjective angles and nuances to cover. Fortunately, the Spartan community worked tirelessly to provide a handy tool to do exactly that whilst covering as many of the nuances/scopes as possible.

### Liquidity Position

When providing liquidity, there are alot of variables at play that affect your position or your scope of how to assess the positions. For instance:
- What assets did you provide as liquidity (SPARTA-only? BNB-only? Half of each?)
- What assets *would you have held* if you did *not* provide liquidity (SPARTA or BNB? Or half of each? Or some other ratio? Or another asset entirely? Maybe a stablecoin?)
- What asset did/will you exit to when you remove liquidity (SPARTA-only? BNB-only? Half of each? Swap it to an entirely different asset?)
- What asset/s do you ultimately believe in long term and *want to accrue more units of*?
- What did you do with your yield after harvesting?
- What did you do with your liquidity after removing?

Unfortunately it is impossible to cover every single scope and nuance, however the liquidity positions page attempts to cover as much of those subjective angles as possible so that you can assess whether you are up or down in whatever your desired scope might be.

### Synth Position

Forging Synth positions has pretty much all the same nuances as the above but are inherantly harder to assess because it is mostly measured in SPARTA (at the time) terms. We can't guess what the asset is that you used to forge the synth nor can we give it a historical value. But again, the contributors worked hard to cover as many scopes as possible to give you the tools to assess your Synthetic asset positions.
